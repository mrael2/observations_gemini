With 7x50 binoculars, I saw Comet ZTF (C/2022 E3) as a faint blob in Camelopardalis near the Little Dipper.

The moon was past 1st quarter (64%), so the sky was washed out, making it harder to identify the Little Dipper asterism, which served to guide me to the comet.

Because of the extremely cold nighttime temperature, I spent only a couple of minutes observing the comet. With averted vision, it clearly stood out as a fuzzy object much larger than any star.

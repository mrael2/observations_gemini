Object: M33

This galaxy at 42x is a large, diaphanous cloud that is dim but at the same time unmistakable. With averted vision, some of the structure seen in photos can begin to be imagined, but M33's appearance at this time of the year is low above the horizon, and clarity can more likely be achieved in winter.

At 84x, I was surprised and impressed to see clarity that was absent at 42x. A bright core is clearly seen, and a large outer spiral is apparent. Hints of internal spiral structure can be seen directly without the need to avert vision.

At 139x, the view becomes dimmer, and the large spiral arm is at the outer edge of the field of view. 84x is the best magnification. I was pleasantly surprised with this galaxy, and I hope one day I can see it when it is higher in the sky for what I suspect would be an even more impressive display.

Time: 9:00 PM

Object: M76

At 139x (its best magnification), this diminutive nebula has an oblong appearance when viewed directly. With averted vision, some semblance of its dumbbell shape can be glimpsed.

Much to my surprise, a short period of hyperventilation (many deep breaths) resulted in a better view! Overall an interesting object easily found.

Time: 9:35 PM

Object: M74

Exceedingly dim at both 42x and 84x, I might have characterized this galaxy as a small nebula instead of a galaxy if I hadn't been told about it in advance. It is not much more than a nearly transparent, cloud-like smudge.

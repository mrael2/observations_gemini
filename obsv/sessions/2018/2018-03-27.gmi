Clouds and snow over the past few days have prevented me from observing. Tonight the sky cleared magnificently on the western horizon, so I attempted to locate Mercury again.

Alas, my search was in vain. After 40 minutes of scanning the sky below and to the north of Venus, which was still and bright in good seeing at 84x, I had to concede that Mercury was too dim to see.

Online resources show Mercury's phase at only 2% lit, and I am sure this is not enough to discern on such a small planet in the bright twilight so close to the Sun -- as it would neet to be to be only 2% lit.

I will try again in the future to observe a thin crescent on Mercury, but it may be months or years before I am fully successful. What a great hunt it's been so far!

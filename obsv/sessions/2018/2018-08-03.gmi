Object: Mars

Just a few days after opposition, Mars was indeed much bigger than it was two years ago. This is the closest opposition since 2003, and I was impressed by the size of the planetary disk at 277x.

Unfortunately, a planet-wide dust storm has been covering Mars for several weeks now, and I saw almost zero detail!!!

However, a polar ice cap was very prominent, and I'm glad I could see this unique feature of the Martian surface.

I have been following the movement of Mars in the early mornings before sunrise for months now. Then as well as now, it has been a magnificent sight along the ecliptic (with the unaided eye).

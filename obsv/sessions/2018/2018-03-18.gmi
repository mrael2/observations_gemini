I'm trying to see some semblance of a phase in Mercury now that it is getting lower in the sky after reaching its highest point (greatest elongation) a few days ago. But poor seeing, probably due to inadequate mirror cooling today, caused me to see only a roiling sphere.

Both at 139x and 277x, Mercury is a dull circle that dances about. I wonder if the view through a refractor would be any better. The phase right now is supposed to be about half lit, but I see no evidence of this.

Mercury is very close to Venus and the 3% waxing crescent Moon, so the sight with the naked eye is quite spectacular!

I took a photo, and there is more evidence of a phase in Mercury in the mildly telephoto image than there was at high magnification in the 10" Dobsonian. The photo suggests that Mercury is about 60% - 70% lit.

Today I had entertained the idea of getting a Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope so that I could view planets at higher magnifications and (presumably) greater clarity, but the mirror in that design may not have been any better this evening.

I may want a refractor after all.

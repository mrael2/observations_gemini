Seeing: II - III
Transparency: 7

Tonight I observed with my nephew Mattias. It was the first time he was able to look at the night sky through my 10" telescope.

We observed Venus, Jupiter with the Great Red Spot visible, and the Moon. I showed him Albireo also.

We attempted to view Saturn, but it was too low in the sky where seeing was abysmal.

Ron and Virginia were also present after 9:30.

We also attempted to view M4, but the Moon was too bright (past 1st quarter) to yield anything but a too-dim fuzziness.

Mattias very much enjoyed the night. He loved using the Telrad and 8x50 finderscope to locate targets. I hope that next summer he can see much more under a moonless sky.

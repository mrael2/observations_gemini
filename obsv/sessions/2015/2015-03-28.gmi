Transparency: 6 (AAAA)

Object: M40 (failed)
Eyepiece: 30 mm (42x)

In bright moonlight, I attempted to locate the double star that is M40. With my star chart, I believe I zeroed in on the target, but I mistakenly believed that I resolved the pair when I saw two stars at opposite ends of the field of view.

This was likely much too great a separation, and I probably needed greater magnification to resolve the pair properly. I believe I failed, so I will try again.

Based on this experience, I probably did not resolve Alcor and Mizar on 2015-03-25 like I thought given that I used a 30 mm eyepiece. I will try again.

Despite having good skies, albeit bright due to the moon, I became suddenly very tired and stopped this observing session early.

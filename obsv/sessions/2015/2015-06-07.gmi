Seeing: I
Transparency: 7

Object: M94
Constellation: Canes Venatici

This galaxy was hard to find and took me about 30 minutes to locate. At 138x (9 mm eyepiece), I noticed a pinpoint core, bright, with a fuzzy outer halo.

Object: M63
Constellation: Canes Venatici

At 10:40 PM and 138x, this galaxy had a dim core with its halo brightness dimming gradually away from the center. As such, M63 appeared brighter than M94 overall.

Tonight's Milky Way was very prominent in Cygnus. What a sight as there was no moon.

Object: M106
Constellation: Canes Venatici

Again at 138x, I spotted this galaxy at 10:50 PM. It was the largest of the three galaxies so far this evening. I noticed a pinpoint core and a much more oblong shape to the galaxy.

Object: M13
Constellation: Hercules

Tonight at 138x, M13 was spectacular! Many stars at the edge and near the center were resolved. Trails of these stars extended outwards at the edges.

Object: M101
Constellation: Ursa Major

Spiral structure very dim tonight at 138x.

Object: M109
Constellation: Ursa Major

Faint and fuzzy with two bright stars near its edge. 138x

M51, Canes Venatici
Nice spiral structure at 138x. Last object of the night at 11:07 PM.

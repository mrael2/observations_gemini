Seeing: I
Transparency: 7
Telescope: 254 mm f/4.92 Newtonian

Objects: M81 and M82
Eyepiece: 30 mm (42x)

Both of these galaxies fit easily into the same field of view with the 30 mm eyepiece.

M81 exhibited a bright core with a dim, elliptical halo of stars surrounding the core.

M82 did not have a bright core but instead had uniform brightness along its entire cigar-shaped length. Yet M82 has a tortured appearance as if scars are on its surface.

M82 was best seen with averted vision. M81 was perhaps twice as large as M82.

A bright star appeared very close to M82's edge, and two other stars nearby formed nearly a straight line.

Exceptional skies in Ursa Major were covered by 9:10 PM by clouds. Tonight's window of good observing was short.

Temperature was above freezing, but I still used long johns and gloves with my hooded winter coat.

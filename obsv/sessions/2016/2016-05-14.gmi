I saw the first quarter Moon setting for probably the first time in my life given the very early morning hour. Rich and clear, its appearance at the western horizon was striking. Once it set, the Milky Way became sharply prominent.

Object: Mars in Scorpius

I spent a full hour observing Mars as it approaches opposition later this month. At 139x, I was initially disappointed because of the tremendous brightness and diffraction spikes, but I soon discovered that observing Mars requires patience and attention.

At 277x, I started to see some detail amid the brightness. This was after only a few minutes observing at 139x. But the limitations of a Barlowed 9 mm eyepiece prompted me to switch to the 9 mm eyepiece by itself, un-Barlowed.

At 139x, I spent the majority of the time with Mars. After much patient and careful examination, I began to see much more detail, and there were astonishing moments of crispness where I saw clear distinctions between the dark maria -- at the southern and northern ends -- and the bright terrae in the middle.

I believe I saw Sinus Meridiani because by observation was that of a dark spot surrounded by a light semi-circle in the southern half of the planet. This was next to a larger dark area which I think was Margaritifer Sinus and Mare Erythraeum.

I could not discern a north polar ice cap due to the overall brightness of the image and diffraction spikes. Maybe I will have a refractor for the next opposition to see what I suspect will be a clearer image.

Seeing was exceptional, but I think thermal currents from my body created ripples in the image. It may have been just the atmosphere.

I can imagine that Mars is a frustrating target at anything other than around its opposition. It is a challenging observation that I need to repeat in the next few days and weeks to get the best impression I can of this interesting little planet.

Time: 3:15 AM - 3:45 AM

Objects: Saturn, M31, M51

Saturn was magnificent at 139x with the Cassini division among the clearest I've seen. I saw some belt detail on the planet's surface as well.

Again at 139x, M31 and M51 looked reasonable but perhaps dimmer due to my eyes losing some dark-adapatedness from the bright planets.

Both Jupiter and Saturn were turbulent, leading me to the recorded seeing rating. Bands on Jupiter were visible, but the Cassini Division on Saturn was not.

The bulk of the night was spent viewing open clusters in Cassiopeia, which were all very enjoyable:

NGC 637
NGC 654
NGC 559/C8
NGC 663/C10
NGC 581/M103
Trumpler 1
NGC 659
NGC 129
NGC 7790
NGC 7789

I viewed NGC 7789 last among all the open clusters, and it was by far the most spectacular!

I also viewed these objects:

Pleiades (M45)
Double Cluster
Andromeda Galaxy (M31)

By the way, all the open clusters in Cas were viewed at 84x, which showed them all at perhaps their best.

Andromeda had a prominent dust lane visible at 84x, and its vast extent was nicely discerned at 42x.

I also caught three or four Taurid meteors tonight, the last of which was a long-lived, bright, and smoky fireball that was a fitting end to an absolutely great night of observing.

Cold temperature but not bad.

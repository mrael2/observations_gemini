James Oliver visited, and I showed him well over a dozen targets. All of them were sights that I have already seen.

Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars were all visible along a nice arc of the ecliptic. Seeing and transparency were all at the highest levels.

We started off by having an astonishing earth grazer meteor pass by in the eastern sky.

I think one of every type of object was seen. James seemed to enjoy the sights, remarking that the views in my 10" reflector were better than he had seen in one of Adams State University's telescopes.

We observed from about 9:00 PM to about 11:00 PM.

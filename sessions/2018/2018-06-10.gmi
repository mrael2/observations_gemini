Transparency: 2 - 7

Object: Jupiter in Libra

Smoke from the "416 Fire" north of Durango, CO obscured the northern sky when I took out the telescope at 8:00 PM to cool. The southern sky was clear at that time. By 9:00 PM, the smoke had drifted to the south, endangering my view of Jupiter. At 9:05 PM, the Great Red Spot was clearly visible and not far from the planet's meridian. By 9:15 PM, however, the smoke began covering the planet. Transparency went from 7 down to 2, and Jupiter became an orange disk because of the smoke. The GRS remained visible at better transparencies, but it disappeared under heavy smoke. Interestingly, the two main belts remained visible throughout.

By 9:25 PM, the smoke cleared and the GRS became prominent again. It appeared centered on the meridian starting at 9:30 PM and lasting until about 9:40 PM. A predicted center time was 9:38 PM. Seeing was poor (III) during its center time, but it improved later to showcase the orange storm as a clear oval in the belt.

This viewing was indeed much clearer at 277x than my last recorded observation, and I hope to have improved seeing at some point in the future when the GRS is visible again.

Off to bed at 10:30 PM as I have to work tomorrow.

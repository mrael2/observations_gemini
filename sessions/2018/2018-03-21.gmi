It was nice to have another twilight iv which Mercury was visible. However, poor seeing caused the apparent phase to be much less crescent-shaped and more gibbous in appearance at 7:40 PM, which is when I first could see the planet after 10 minutes of searching in a still-bright sky. By 8:00 PM, the planet was a roiling, circular blob.

The telescope had a good 90 minutes of cool-down time, and I observed exclusively at 138x.

The crescent Moon at 138x was quite astonishing and sharp despite the roiling atmosphere (even at its higher elevation).

Venus was seemingly full, turbulent, and non-descript.

At the end of this short session, I viewed the 4 stars in the Trapezium of M42 in still-light skies.

Here's hoping for a few more days in which I can observe the caving phases of Mercury.

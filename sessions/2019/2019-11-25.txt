Clouds obstructed the view for much of the morning, but I finally saw the thinnest crescent Moon I have ever seen. With 7x50 binoculars, in the glare of the soon-to-rise sun, I saw what was reported to be a 1% illuminated Moon. The sliver of light at the Moon's bottom edge was faint and slight. Without the use of optics, I'm sure I never would have seen it.

Earlier in the morning, I saw Mercury, Mars, and Spica again. The color contrast among these objects is strikingly beautiful with a prominent white, orange, and blue, respectively, appearing in my binocular view.

As with everything in life, luck played a role in being able to see these sights today, and I hope to see much more again soon.

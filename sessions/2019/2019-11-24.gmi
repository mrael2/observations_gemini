In a clear and cloudless sky, I observed the beautiful sight of Spica, Mars, and Mercury all in a straight line, diagonal in its appearance, with the thin crescent Moon just a few degrees to the left of Mars.

Through Fujinon 7x50 binoculars, Mars was tiny but distinctively orange. Spica had a light blue hue, and Mercury was a stark white. The Moon and Mars appeared together nicely in the binocular field of view.

Even as the sun started to brighten the horizon, I looked to the southwest and saw Canis Major low in the sky. Sirius blazed brightly, and it pointed me to barely visible Orion.

I observed from within my house on this cold autumn morning.

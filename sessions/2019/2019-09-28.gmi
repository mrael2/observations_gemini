Object: M77

This galaxy, the last Messier object I observed, has a core very much like a star. It is adjacent to a star of similar magnitude, but the galaxy only shows its dim halo well at 139x. At 42x, it is more like a star than a galaxy. Very small object of little interest. I am happy to have seen all of the Messier objects at long last!

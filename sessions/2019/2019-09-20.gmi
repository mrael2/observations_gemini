This globular cluster at 139x is medium-sized with several stars resolved around its edge. At this magnification, a bright star appears in the same field of view. Quite symmetrical.

Object: M2

Globular cluster has compact, smallish, and dim appearance at 139x. A handful of stars are resolved around the edges.

Object: M72

Infinitesimal at 42x, this globular cluster is a mere smudge at 139x. It's a wonder that Messier could see it, as it is as dim as some galaxies that I've disdained.

Object: M73

This pointless little four-star cluster does look like a Y-shaped rocket ship, but it was so hard to find, and it is small and unimpressive at 139x.

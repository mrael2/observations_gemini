I took out the 10" Newtonian tonight on my 50th birthday for the first time this year. The temperature was frigid, just above freezing. This was the first night of spring without clouds.

I saw some familiar sights to start: a 2% waxing Moon, M44, M42, and M45.

I then moved on to NGC 3242, which is also Caldwell 59 and is known as the Ghost of Jupiter. I observed it as a small, nearly spherical orb which did not look like Jupiter at all but which instead looked more like Uranus. The color was turquoise blue and had a fuzziness around its perimeter. It was quite small, and I nearly mistook it for a star at 42x. The description above was at 139x. Very interesting planetary nebula.

I then attempted to find IC 3568 but failed.

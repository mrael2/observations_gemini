Object: M7 in Scorpius

Visible to the naked eye as a smudge, M7 becomes a wondrous open cluster of perhaps > 50 stars with a 30 mm eyepiece. Very nice!

Object: M6 in Scorpius

Less apparent to the naked eye -- but still perceptible -- M6 has the shape of a winged insect. One star stands out on the right wingtip. Quite beautiful!

Object: M62 in Ophiuchus

Tiny and fuzzy with the 30 mm eyepiece, this globular cluster remained fuzzy using a 9 mm eyepiece. It is brighter than most galaxies, but it is galaxy-like in its appearance.

Object: M19 in Ophiuchus

This globular cluster was small, faint, and fuzzy. With averted vision, I might have resolved two stars at the cluster's edges using the 9 mm eyepiece.

Object: M8 in Sagittarius

Lagoon Nebula and accompanying cluster are magnificent!

Object: M21 in Sagittarius

This open cluster at 84x has a nearly perfect circle of stars near its center. At 42x, the cluster appears much smaller, though about the same size as M20, which is in the same field of view. Nice.

This was the first good observing night in all summer! Not a cloud in the sky. A great night after a long time without good skies.

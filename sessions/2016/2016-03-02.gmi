Object: Zodiacal Light

Winter is coming to a close, but the nights are still cold.

From the comfort of the interior of my home, I observed the zodiacal light for the first time ever, knowingly.

A distinct band of light -- tall and slightly left-leaning -- appeared on the western horizon. Photographs taken with 10-second exposures really make it clear how pronounced this light is at the end of astronomical twilight.

I look forward to more observations of this phenomenon, none likely to be written about, in the future. Very appealing.

Also, I hope to begin new telescopic observations soon as the weather warms.

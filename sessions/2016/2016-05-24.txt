Object: Mars in Scorpius

Shortly after opposition, Mars may have been slightly bigger and brighter than at my last viewing, but detail was substantially reduced, probably because of the seeing and low position of the planet in the sky.

I may have seen significant cloud cover at the pole most inclined to Earth. At 139x, the view was no different than at 277x.

I won't bother to viet Mars at its closest approach around May 30th. The planet is just not interesting enough for me to bother.

It does look nice in the sky when viewed with the naked eye without optical aid! It is very bright and reddish.

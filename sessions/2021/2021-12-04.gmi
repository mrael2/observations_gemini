NGC 7129 appeared as a set of three stars inside of a faint nebula. Two stars immediately adjacent to the nebulosity can be thought of as a handle to the stars within the nebula. Also known as the Little Pleiades, I can see the pattern, more or less, that is found in the Pleiades.

Also known as O'Meara's Secret Deep 103, I marvel yet again that O'Meara can see in a five-inch refractor pretty much exactly what I see in my 10-inch reflector (based on his sketch in the book). I could not confirm nearby NGC 7142, an open cluster. A small article on NGC 7129 appeared in the Nov. 25th edition of the Taos News.

I am surprised how warm this December night is (above freezing)!

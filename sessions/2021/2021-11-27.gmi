Object: NGC 7023 (C4)
Caldwell 4 is a reflection nebula surrounding a star. At 84x, the glow around the star is perceptible, but at 139x there is detail in the nebulosity when using averted vision. It's not a large nebula. The target is of medium interest.

The evening temperature became cold quite quickly, and I suspect that I will be pausing telescopic observations until the springtime.

Double star Eta Cas required 139x to split cleanly. The dim small companion is orange. This is a tight, pretty pair.

At 84x, the nebulosity surrounding this open cluster (NGC 281) is more prominent (with averted vision) than the cluster itself. Prolonged study is needed.

I tried but could not properly identify NGC 225. The Milky Way in this region adds to a confusing view.

M52 is a very pleasing open cluster at 84x.

Object: NGC 7635
Dim and ill-defined, the nebulosity surrounds a bright star, but I could not identify the supposedly small Bubble Nebula within the nebulosity. Poor target.

Object: NGC 7521 (C28)
Caldwell 28 is a large, magnificent open cluster that overflows the view at 42x. It rivals M44 in its size and in the brightness of its stars. Very nice and worth seeing again.

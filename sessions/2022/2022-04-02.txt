40mm


About 15 stars in a grouping that has a core symmetry. At three apexes, two stars appear, giving the triangle a hexagonal quality. Other stars branch off from the core forming "wings." I see a bat with an apex of two stars forming the eyes.

C64 40mm

Small, dense individual stars visible in a hazy ball.

12 mm: A bright central star within the cluster has nebulosity surrounding it. The rest of the cluster is symmetrical with sharp, pinpoint stars all around. Beautiful! Almost triangular.

8:54 PM C58 12 mm
Dozens of dim stars compactly grouped
40 mm: Noticeably dense grouping in an already dense star field near a bright star.

C54 40 mm Same as C58 but no nearby bright star
12 mm Dim open cluster with hazy sections having unresolved stars. Resolved stars are dim. Averted visions helps.

9:04 PM
C50 12 mm
About a dozen bright stars loosely spread out over nearly the entire (70-80%) field of view. Pretty!
40 mm Ill-defined against background stars (not well defined) but some trapezoidal symmetry perceived.

C49 40 mm Difficult to perceive. Does this nebula surround the outer edge of the C50 cluster? If so, a diaphanous cloud is seemingly present, but almost imagined.

9:20 PM C46 40 mm Not detected.
12 mm Quite small with a comet-like triangular tail emanating from a brighter "head."

9:34 PM C39 12 mm
Bright circular halo surrounds a brighter central region. Small at this magnification. Close to a nearby star.
5 mm
This planetary nebula still nicely seen at this magnification w/same description.

9:46 PM C25 12 mm Exceedingly dim, almost imperceptible. Round fuzziness at the end of a line of two stars. Averted vision is a must.

10 PM C31 12 mm
This is an unimpressive, dim nebulosity around a star. The nearby star group is more interesting.

10 PM C71 12 mm
Nice open cluster of medium bright stars filling 50% of the field of view. Low on southwest horizon, but transparency is still 6 or 7.

10:05 PM C79 12 mm

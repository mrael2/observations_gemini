The Moon is one day past 1st quarter, 53% visible, so I'm not sure how well these objects will be seen.

M13 12 mm 9:00 PM Transparency: 7

With the Moon washing out the sky, M13 appears dim. The reduced aperture of my refractor likely also has a major influence on the object's appearance, but I do see some resolved stars in the cluster.

C76 12 mm

This open cluster is small with about a dozen bright stars apparent in the moonlight. Quite nice. Asymmetrical.

Saturn 5 mm 9:25 PM Seeing II-III

The Cassini Division could not be seen due to a roiling atmosphere, but my tracking mount allows for much more pleasing observations of the planet.

Jupiter 5 mm 9:39 PM Seeing III

Three moons around Jupiter were visible, but the planet wasn't very high above the eastern horizon, so one band was barely perceptible.

C16 40 mm

Not knowing in advance what type of object this is, I presume it is a large, vast open cluster. At 25x, the field of view is filled with a sparse scattering of medium-bright stars.

NGC 457 40 mm

This cluster is sharply defined in the wide field.

Albireo 40 mm

This double star is prominent even in the wide field, but color is not apparent.

NGC 7789 40 mm 10:10 PM

With the Moon as bright as it is (53%), I nearly thought this cluster to be invisible, but closer observation showed a faint white rose in the wide field. The Moon has really made many targets inaccessible tonight.

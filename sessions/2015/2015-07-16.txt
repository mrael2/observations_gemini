Venus in bright twilight had a lovely crescent of about 20% illuminated. Viewed at 138x, the planet was about five degrees above the western horizon.

Jupiter had three moons visible along with two bands on its surface. Again at 138x, its recent conjunction with Venus placed it still about five degrees above the western horizon.

Object: M64

This galaxy was asymmetrical with a hint of a dark lane across its center using averted visions at 138x. At 84x, I noticed a starlike nucleus.

Object: M85
Time: 10:28 PM MDT

I observed a star within this galaxy's boundary. Another star nearby combined with NGC 4394 (which was exceedingly dim) and a 4th star made a nice trapezoid shape. Observed at 84x.

Time: 10:37 PM MDT
Object: Albireo

At 42x, this double star was clearly separated, but the pair was quite close together.

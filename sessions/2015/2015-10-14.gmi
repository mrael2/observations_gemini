Object: M56
Const.: Lyra

This globular cluster is small, dim, and fuzzy and 138x with almost no stars resolved. Perhaps a half dozen faint stars can be identified as resolved around the center, but the core remains hazy.

Object: M71
Const.: Sagitta
Time: 8:27 PM

At 138x, this globular cluster is asymmetrical, spread-out, and of medium brightness. Some stars are clearly resolved around the hazy edges, but I wonder if these stars are part of the cluster or if they are just part of the surrounding star field, which is sprinkled widely throughout the field of view.

Object: M27
Const.: Vulpecula

At 138x, this planetary nebula is striking and exhibits a football shape with averted vision. The pointy ends of the football tend to fade with direct vision, and in that case, the central dumbbell shape is more apparent. The central nebulosity is consistently dense within the outline of the dumbbell, and I'd characterize the brightness as high-medium.

At 84x, M27 becomes more diffuse and almost circular. The dumbbell shape is less apparent at this magnification, and the appearance is more cloud-like.

Object: M29
Const.: Cygnus

This is a lovely, sparse open cluster with eight bright stars and perhaps a similar number of very faint companions interspersed among the bright ones. At 84x, there ane six stars that have a symmetry in their position as follows:

This is a large open cluster requiring 42x to see in its entirety. There are about 20 bright stars spread widely across the field of view, and a small, tight pair marks the center of the asymmetrical shape. Yet I do detect a triangular shape to the cluster.

Great night, done at 9:30 PM. Gloves needed. Cold! Autumn is here.

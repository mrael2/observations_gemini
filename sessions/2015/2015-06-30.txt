Venus and Jupiter conjunction

At 84x, both planets were in the field of view. Clouds prevented me from seeing belts on Jupiter's surface, but I did glimpse 2 or 3 of Jupiter's moons.

Venus had a very nice crescent shape. I'd estimate about 20-30% illuminated. The clouds were so heavy that I could not make out the two planets separately with the naked eye. At only ~0.33 degrees apart, I could only detect a fuzzy single bright light in the sky with the naked eye. The telescope gave the only good view of the planets separated by a discernible distance.

The moon is 99% full. Temperature is a warm 23 degrees C.

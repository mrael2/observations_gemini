Object: Messier 42 & 43

Description: This was my first observation of the Orion Nebula. M42 took up most of the field of view with a very prominent "fish's mouth" pointing to M43. Four sharp, pinpoint stars were near M42's "fish's mouth," but these were not the four stars of the Trapezium. I saw the Trapezium as only one star; maybe more magnification will allow me to resolve the four stars of the Trapezium. The other three stars (of the four) that I saw were lined up in a straight line. I'll need a star chart to identify these properly.

The nebula itself had the appearance of a dense cloud. Part of this cloud "sharpened" into a tail of sorts to one side of the "fish's mouth." The nebula had an almost wing-like shape when examined overall.

M43 appeared only as a circular fuzzy cloud across the dust lane (dark dust lane) between the mouth and M43. I could not detect a comma or apostrophe shape to M43 as I've seen in photos. I could, however, detect brightness at the center of M43.

Object: Comet Lovejoy (C/2014 Q2)

Notes: Again I observed this comet in Cassiopeia to confirm its movement against the background stars. Indeed, the surrounding stars were quite different compared to two nights ago.

Location: east of Antonito, CO

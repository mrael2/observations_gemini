Time: 10:00 PM MDT to 10:40 PM MDT
Seeing: II
Transparency: 6
Telescope: 254 mm f/4.92 Newtonian reflector

Object: M37
Eyepiece: 30 mm (42x) and with 2x Barlow (84x)

I noticed immediately in this open cluster in Auriga an orange central star at 42x. The entire cluster was more favorably viewed at 84x, but the orange central star was more prominent at 42x.

Object: M36
Constellation: Auriga
Eyepiece: 42x

M36 is smaller in size than M37, and I noted fewer stars. I estimated about 30 easily viewable stars in the cluster. This open cluster is pretty with brighter stars than in M37.

Object: M38
Constellation: Auriga
Eyepiece: 42x

M38 is much more scattered than the other two open clusters seen tonight.

Clouds covered parts of Auriga for part of the session, so I observed other targets waiting for clouds to clear.

Object: M51
Constellation: Canes Venatici

I actually wore an eye patch for an hour before observing M51 in hopes of seeing spiral arms. No such luck, especially since the moon was out. I did, however, glimpse more of a surrounding cloud than before. Dark skies are needed.

Tonight I also viewed M81, M82, Jupiter, and Venus.

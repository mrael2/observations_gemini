Clearly visible in M51 were its two components, each with a bright center. Close together as they are, the galaxies had only a hint of cloudy connection between them.

For only a brief period was I able to distinguish what might have been spiral structure in the larger component, but this faded, perhaps because of less than ideal transparency in tonight's sky, which had clouds but was the first night with some clarity in many days.

Sketches of M51 online made from scopes of similar aperture to mine show distinct spiral structure. My skies must not be dark enough. A crescent moon tonight did not help, but its presence next to Venus was a lovely sight.

For some reason, I have hope that I shall see the spiral arms of M51 some day, but it may require travel to a darker site, which I have not yet undertaken with my 10" Newtonian reflector.

My observing adventures have only just begun.

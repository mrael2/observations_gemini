Ophiuchus

At 138x, this globular cluster is much too dim with the strong moonlight. I'll try again on a moonless night.

Time: 9:24 PM MDT
Object: Albireo
Const: Cygnus

This beautiful double star splits nicely at 138x. The yellow companion is brightest, but the blue companion looks just as nice!

At 277x and 138x, the Cassini Division is not visible due to poor seeing.

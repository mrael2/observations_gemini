The crescent moon is just about to set within 15 minutes or so.

Object: M25 in Sagittarius

At 42x, the center of this open cluster shows seven tiny, pinprick stars clearly resolved. The cluster takes up 50% - 60% of the field of view, and I can get two bright nearby stars into the FOV which are just north of M25.

Perhaps 50-100 stars are scattered sparsely throughout. Nice.

Object: M18 in Sagittarius

At 42x, this is an astonishingly small open cluster with about 15-20 stars visible. In the finderscope, it is a clear patch of fuzz, so I expected more stars in the cluster at 42x. Quite a surprise.

Crescent moon has set.

Object: Omega Nebula, M17
Const.: Sagittarius

At 84x, there is a central bar of nebulosity that is about 3 or 4 times as long as it is wide. At one end of the bar, a bright, curled wisp arcs off the bar's end. At the other end of the bar, there is darkness along the bar's line for about half the bar's length before dim additional clouds of nebulosity can be seen.

A small open cluster of about 15 stars is immediately adjacent to the nebula's bar.

Object: M16, Eagle Nebula
Const.: Serpens Cauda

The best and brightest view came at 84x, but at that magnification the nebula is dim. It surrounds a small open cluster of about 20-40 stars. A dark rift is visible in the nebula.

Object: M26 in Scutum

There are about a dozen compressed stars of prominence in this small, open cluster. Not very remarkable. 84x.

Object: M11 in Scutum

At 84x, this open cluster is quite pleasing with a prominent bright star near the center. The cluster is compact and spherical, suggesting a globular cluster, but there is not the same hazy density in the center that globulars exhibit.

I'd guess about 50-100 stars are visibly resolved in this open cluster.

Time: 10:00 PM MDT
Object: M13 in Hercules

At 84x, M13 is magnificent as usual.

A great night!

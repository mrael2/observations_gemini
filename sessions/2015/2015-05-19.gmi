Object: M48
42x
Constellation: Hydra

This open cluster was quite pretty and fit entirely within the field of view. Stars were sharp, and some formed an arrow shape at the center of the cluster.

Object: M109

At 42x, this galaxy in Ursa Major was quite dim. At 138x, it seemed even dimmer. Uninspiring.

Object: M57, the Ring Nebula

At 138x, the ring shape, slightly oval in appearance, was clear. Averted vision gave an even more pronounced darkness to the center of the ring. This is worth re-observing multiple times.

Object: Omega Centauri

At 138x, this globular cluster filled the field of view. This time I could resolve individual stars without the previous appearance as just a gray blob. Nice.

Object: M13

At 138x, this globular cluster had even more resolved stars than before (and seemingly more than Omega Centauri). The sky was dark, and M13 was bright and vibrant.

Object: M101

To my utter amazement, I saw hints of spiral structure at 138x with much more brightness! Previous observations were done under skies that were not as dark as tonight. I was very pleased with the view. It appears much larger and brighter on a dark night.

Object: M51

At 138x, spiral structure was clear tonight on this galaxy that is becoming my favorite.

Object: Saturn in Scorpius

The planet is near opposition, and the view tonight was the best I've had so far. At 277x (9 mm eyepiece w/2x Barlow), I could see the Cassini Division clearly along with banding on the planet itself.

Object: Jupiter in Cancer

Jupiter did not hold up as well as Saturn tonight at 277x. However, I had much better views at this magnification than before. Tracking was a bit easier tonight as I'm continuing to gain practice with my Dobsonian.

Heavy dew by 10:30 - 11:00. Cold, gloves needed.

Telescope and location typical:
- 254 mm f/4.92 Newtonian reflector on Dobsonian mount
- just outside my back door, north of my house. Near La Florida, which is ~5 miles ESE of Antonito, CO

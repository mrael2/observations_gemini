Object: M28
Sagittarius

At 277x, outer stars are resolved in this small globular cluster, but the center remains unresolved but bright.

At 138x, the view is more appealing in which the outer halo does still show a few resolved stars, but most appear as fine dust.

Object: M22
Sagittarius

At 138x, numerous stars are resolved from edge to edge in this large globular cluster. One (perhaps two) stars exhibit an orange color, one being quite sharp, at the cluster's edge (in just a bit from the edge, actually). Very nice!

Object: M8 (Lagoon Nebula)
Sagittarius

At 138x, this is a spectacular nebula with a bright pair of stars (really 3 stars, not 2) in the main nebulosity. A brilliant open cluster (NGC6530) is immediately adjacent to the secondary nebulosity, and a dark lane of open sky (with a few stars present in the darkness) separating the two nebulosities. Magnificent!

At 84x, the entire nebula is in the eyepiece field of view. Superb!

Object: M20 Trifid Nebula
Sagittarius

What a beautiful picture at 84x. The dark lanes that separate the cloud of light into three distinct sub-nebulae have near their center a pair of pinpoint, very close stars. Time is 10:20 PM MDT.

Sharp and lovely.

Dimmer than previous observation with dark lanes NOT apparent.

Dew forming. 11:00 PM ending time. Tired.

Tried but failed to find NGC7000 (North American Nebula)

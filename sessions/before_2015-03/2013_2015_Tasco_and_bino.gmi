Saturn with its rings

Andromeda Galaxy (M31)
I aligned the equatorial mount properly for this very satisfying viewing session.

Venus, including its phase of slightly more than half lit.

M45, the Pleiades, using my Micro Four Thirds camera at 200 mm. The photo is acceptable, and I'm discovering that an alt-azimuth mount is much easier to deal with than an equatorial mount. Perhaps a Dobsonian telescope is in my future.

One of these dimmer three (as seen in a binocular field) may be comet ISON. Check for movement tomorrow.

The middle object moved. In 7x35 binoculars I thought I could detect a tail on the now much-lower object.

Jupiter, in the evening sky (east)

In the 4.5" reflector, this planet is but a small disk. No details visible.

Venus with a slim crescent phase. Jupiter and its moons.

At dusk, conjunction of young crescent moon, Venus, and Mars. Mars was dim but visible with the naked eye. No telescope used for this observation.

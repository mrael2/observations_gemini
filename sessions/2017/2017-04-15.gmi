Object: M1
Const.: Taurus

M1 seen as dim, oval-shaped blob. Not impressive using 30 mm eyepiece with 2x Barlow (84x).

Object: M34
Const.: Perseus

M34 is an open cluster of about 20 stars. Nicely seen with 30mm and 2x Barlow (84x). It has a spider-like appearance with 4 or 5 prominent "legs" radiating outward.

Very cold this evening. I used heavy gloves, long underwear, etc.

Jupiter viewed briefly with all its moons visible.

Object: M78
Const.: Orion

M78 is a nebula perhaps slightly more dim than M1, but it is more interesting because of two stars embedded in the nebula. One is at the nebula's edge while the other is more inward. Size is perhaps slightly smaller than M1, but again more interesting. Viewed at 84x.

Object: M35
Const.: Gemini

M35 is a stunning open cluster w/30mm and 2x Barlow (84x). Multiple dozens of stars are crisply seen. Using only the 30 mm, the cluster is nicely defined albeit slightly nebulous in appearance. Using the 30 mm, I also saw the two smaller open clusters near M35: NGC2158 and IC2157.
